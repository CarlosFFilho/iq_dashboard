# iq_dashboard

IQ, or Intelligence Quotient, is a measure that seeks to evaluate a person's cognitive ability in relation to the population average. It is often measured by standardized tests that assess skills such as logical reasoning, verbal comprehension, mathematical and visual-spatial skills. From a global perspective, IQ is measured using tests validated and standardized in different countries to ensure a comparable assessment between people from different cultures and socioeconomic contexts.

This project aims to build a dashboard in Power BI with global IQ values. The data was previously processed using Python programming.

Important correlations are observed between the project variables, with the exception of the Nobel Prizes.
